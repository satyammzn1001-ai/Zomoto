🍴 Zomato Data Analysis – EDA Project
📘 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset, focusing on understanding restaurant trends, online delivery preferences, cuisines, and country-wise insights.
The analysis is implemented in Python using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to extract meaningful insights from real-world restaurant data.
